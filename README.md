### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a musician and teacher turned coder. I love learning. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a tool that I wish I had as a music teacher. Harmony Helper is an app for high school and college music theory students to check their counterpoint composition assignments without needing an instructor to manually review their work.
