## Hi there, I'm [Chris](https://chrisfrick.github.io/portfolio/) ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a musician and teacher turned developer.

I'm a graduate of the FastTrack Java Developer program and completed the University of Helsinkiâ€™s Full Stack Open web development curriculum.

Iâ€™m currently working on building a tool that I wish I had as a music teacher. [Harmony Helper](https://github.com/chrisfrick/counterpoint-analysis-playground) is an app for high school and college music theory students to check for errors in their counterpoint composition assignments without needing an instructor to manually review their work.
